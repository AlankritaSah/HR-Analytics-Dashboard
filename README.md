Data modeling was performed within Power BI to create relationships between the relevant tables in the dataset. This step ensured that the data could be properly analyzed and visualized.

* Data Cleaning and Transformation:
Power BI's data transformation features, such as Power Query, were utilized to clean and transform the data. Irrelevant entries, duplicates,null values and inconsistencies were removed or resolved, ensuring the data was accurate and reliable.

The dashboard, "HR Analytics," was created to provide an overview of the average emplyee attrition rate based on various KPIs. This dashboard focused on presenting high-level metrics, such as employee attrition on the basis of education, age, salary slab, years spent in the company, and job role respectively. Visualizations like charts, graphs, and tables were used to convey the key insights effectively. A table that shows the ratings given by each employee before leaving the company was also formed making a Job Role Satisfaction table.
